# Welcome to the Machine Learning Team!
The scripts containing the algorithm classes can be found in their respective folders.
"Pymunk.py" and "Unity.py" contain the code needed to run our algorithms in those respective simulations.

To test an algorithm in our simulations, first ensure that the nescessary components are installed using:
pip install theano keras tqdm numpy matplotlib pandas pymunk pyglet pynput

and then run "main.py".

See the guide on how to set up machine learning in the Guides/ directory for more info.
